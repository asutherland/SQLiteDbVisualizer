* SQLiteDbVisualizer
  /SQLiteDbVisualizer/ is a tool to visualize SQLite databases.

  It is fairly useful to see the extent of fragmentation in a database.
  It is *not* a database schema visualizer.

  [[http://github.com/laysakura/SQLiteDbVisualizer/raw/master/doc/mainView.png]]

* Use case
** See fragmentation and issue VACUUM
   [[http://github.com/laysakura/SQLiteDbVisualizer/raw/master/doc/fragmented.png]]
   [[http://github.com/laysakura/SQLiteDbVisualizer/raw/master/doc/fragmentedVacuumed.png]]

   A database seems fragmented (left).
   Then issue /VACUUM/ command and defragment it (right).
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ sqlite3 foobar.db vacuum
   #+END_SRC

** Filter database pages by B-tree
   [[http://github.com/laysakura/SQLiteDbVisualizer/raw/master/doc/mainView.png]]

   If you just want to see records in table /T0/ , then you can filter the output.

* Usage
  SQLiteDbVisualizer command (/sqlite-visualizer/) has svn-like subcommand interfaces.
  The simplest usage to visualize a SQLite database as SVG image is shown below.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ sqlite-visualizer svg foobar.db foobar.svg
  #+END_SRC

  For more detailed usage, use help options.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ sqlite-visualizer -h
$ sqlite-visualizer svg -h
  #+END_SRC

* Requirements
  - Python (checked with v2.7.2)
  - sqlite3 python module
  - SQLite3 database (checked with v3.7.14)
  - PySVG
    - http://code.google.com/p/pysvg/

* Features
** Filtering by B-tree
   Use /--filterBtrees/ option to get only pages of your interest.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ sqlite-visualizer svg foobar.db foobar.svg --filterBtrees T0 T0_idx  # Show only pages related to table "T0" and index "T0_idx"
   #+END_SRC

** Pluggable visualizer unit
   /SQLiteDbVisualizer/ has /database analyzer/ and /visualizer/ modules separately.
   Database analyzer (/SQLiteAnalyzer.py/) reads a SQLite database and output its information in JSON form.
   See the JSON format in /DbInfoTemplate.py/ .

   Only SVG format is supported currently (/Json2Svg.py/).
   Looking forward to other visualizers' pull requests!

* Limitations
  - WAL mode database is not supported
    - http://www.sqlite.org/wal.html
  - Only UTF-8 is supported as TEXT encoding (easily fixed)
  - Not suitable for quite large databases mainly because SVG is
    not so good format to visualize large images.
    A kind of sophisticated GUI might be a good solution for large databases.
    Hope some implementation making use of pluggable visualizer unit :D

* Methodology
  SQLiteDbVisualizer is written carefully referring to http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html .
  Here is the explanation of a bit complicated methods to analyze SQLite database.

** Specify page types
*** B-tree page
    1. Assume a page has b-tree header and read b-tree header flag, cell counts,
       offset to first free-block, and offset to cell content area.
    2. Check if b-tree header flag is either of 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x02, or 0x05.
    3. Check if both offset to first free-block and offset to cell content area are
       between b-tree header length (= 8 or 12) and page size, or 0.
    4. Check if cell count is between 0 and (page size) / (minimum cell length (= 5))

*** Overflow page
    A cell with large payload cell can have a link to overflow page.
    (It is complicated to determine whether a payload is split into overflow pages.
    See "Track overflow pages" for detail.)
    Jump to the overflow page and read overflow page header to get a pointer to next overflow page.
    Last overflow page has 0x00 as a overflow page header.

*** Other pages
    Not supported yet

** Track overflow pages
   1. Read a payloadSize from a cell.
   2. usableSize = pageSize - reservedSpace.
      Both pageSize and reservedSpace are read from database header.
   3. maxLocal = usableSize - 35
   4. minLocal = ((usableSize - 12) * 32/255) - 23
   5. If payloadSize <= maxLocal, there is no overflow page for the cell
   6. Else, let localSize = minLocal + ((payloadSize - minLocal) % (usableSize - 4))
      a. If localSize > maxLocal, minLocal bytes are in this page.
      b. Else, localSize bytes are in this page.
   7. Remnant payload is split into overflow pages.
      Overflow page number is in the last 4 bytes in the cell.
   8. Each overflow page has a link to the next overflow page in page[0x00-0x03].
      Page[0x04 - usableSize] is reserved exclusively for the part of the payload.

** Read payloads
   1. Read a varint from offset 0 (payloadHeaderSize).
      Let the varint size be firstStypeOffset.
   2. Read varints from firstStypeOffset to payloadHeaderSize.
      Treat each value as a Serial Type.
      (See: http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html - Serial Type Codes Of The Record Format)
   3. Payload values follow the varints.
      Each size of the values is calculated from the table "Serial Type Codes Of The Record Format".
   4. payloadHeaderSize + sum(valueSize) is the payload size.

** Relate B-tree and pages
   It is beneficial to see the b-tree name (table name or index name) for each b-tree page.
   But unfortunately, either b-tree pages and cells do not have b-tree name information.

   To relate B-tree and pages, tree traversal method was used.
   /sqlite_master/ table (in first page) has page numbers of root b-trees.
   And each b-tree interior page has its children pages (nodes) information.
   (Strictly speaking, a left child is held by a cell and the rightmost child is held by b-tree header.)

   Give the b-tree name to each b-tree page while traversal.
